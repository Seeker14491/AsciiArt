# AsciiArt

This program produces an image made of ASCII characters, given an input image.

### Usage

Assuming you have [Stack](https://www.haskellstack.org) installed, run these commands in this directory to build the executable:

```
stack setup
stack build
```

Then, to run the program use one of these commands, depending on your OS:

**Windows**
```
stack exec AsciiArt-exe <input image>
```

**OSX (and others, I think)**
```
stack exec AsciiArt <input image>
```
